# Project 2 - *i_am_rich*

Submitted by: **Ali Mounim Rajabi**

**i_am_rich** iOS app is a simple beginner project that introduces the fundamentals of app development using Xcode.
In creating it, I learned how to set up a project, navigate Xcode’s panels and menus, and design a user interface
with labels, images, and an app icon. Building and running the app gave me hands-on experience with the full development
cycle—from concept to deployment—while also helping me practice core design skills and get familiar with the iOS development environment.
